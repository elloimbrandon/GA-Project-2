      "Head out on this 2.4-mile loop trail near Montgomery, Alabama. Generally considered an easy route, it takes an average of 52 min to complete. This is a popular trail for birding, hiking, and mountain biking, but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day. The trail is open year-round and is beautiful to visit anytime. Dogs are welcome, but must be on a leash.",
