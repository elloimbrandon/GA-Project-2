      "Tom's Thumb is one of the best hikes in Scottsdale, notable for its smooth trail surface, great signage, and interesting rock features. King of all the rock features along this hike is the hike's namesake and turn-around point: Tom's Thumb. At 1.4 billion years old, the towering granite slabs of Tom's Thumb have stood the test of time and are truly a sight to see.",
